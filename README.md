# !!!!!!!! DEPRECATION NOTICE !!!!!!!!

Strangelove has moved to a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) monitoring and alerting stack. As such, we
will no longer monitor chains through HalfLife. In the near future, this repository will be archived and made read-only.

Strangelove will no longer maintain HalfLife. Please fork and use as you see fit.

We will only accept critical bug fix contributions. New features will not be accepted.

# HalfLife

HalfLife is a Cosmos-based blockchain validator monitoring and alerting utility

Monitors and alerts for scenarios such as:
- Slashing period uptime
- Recent missed blocks (is the validator signing currently)
- Jailed status
- Tombstoned status
- Individual sentry nodes unreachable/out of sync
- Chain halted

Discord messages are created in the configured webhook channel for:
- Current validator status
- Detected alerts

## Quick start

### Download

Binaries are available on the [releases](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/half-life/releases) page.

### Setup config.yaml

Copy `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml` and populate with your discord and validator information.
You can optionally provide the `sentries` array to also monitor the sentries via grpc.
`rpc-retries` can optionally be provided to override the default of 5 RPC retries before alerting, useful for congested RPC servers.
`fullnode` can be set to `true` to only monitor reachable and out of sync for the provided `sentries`. `address` is not required when `fullnode` is `true`.
`sentry-grpc-error-threshold` can be provided for each validator to tune how many grpc errors are detected (roughtly 30 seconds between checks) before issuing a notification.

See [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) for how to create a webhook for a discord channel.

Once you've created the webhook, copy the URL. It'll look something like this: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/978129125394247720/cwM4Ks-kWcK3Jsg4I_cboauYjOa48ngI2VKaS76afsMwuY7-U4Frw3BGcYXCJvZJ2kWD`

This will be used later to be put into the config.yaml. The webhook id is `978129125394247720` (from the URL), and webhook token is `cwM4Ks-kWcK3Jsg4I_cboauYjOa48ngI2VKaS76afsMwuY7-U4Frw3BGcYXCJvZJ2kWD`

Save the values as follows (note these values are from the URL):
```yml:
webhook:
  id: 978129125394247720
  token: cwM4Ks-kWcK3Jsg4I_cboauYjOa48ngI2VKaS76afsMwuY7-U4Frw3BGcYXCJvZJ2kWD
```

### Start monitoring

Begin monitoring with:

```bash
halflife monitor
```

By default, `half-life monitor` will look for `config.yaml` in the current working directory. To specify a different config file path, use the `--file`/`-f` flag:

```bash
halflife monitor -f ~/config.yaml
```

When a validator is first added to `config.yaml` and halflife is started, a status message will be created in the discord channel and the ID of that message will be added to `config.yaml`. Pin this message so that the channel's pinned messages can act as a dashboard to see the realtime status of the validators.

Alerts will be posted when any error conditions are detected, and follow up messages will be posted when those errors are cleared.

For high and critical errors, the configured discord user IDs will be tagged
